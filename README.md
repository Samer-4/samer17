# About me

Hi, I’m Samer, a senior at UC San Diego studying Cognitive Science with a specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation. I’m passionate about working with data and leveraging computational techniques to better understand the brain and human cognition. My interests lie at the intersection of AI, neuroscience, and data analysis, and I’m excited to apply my skills to solve complex, real-world problems.

My academic experience has allowed me to develop a strong foundation in machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and computational modeling, which I’m constantly looking to refine through hands-on projects and research.
